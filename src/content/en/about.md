# Doctors tracker

Access to healthcare starts [by choosing a personal doctor](https://e-uprava.gov.si/podrocja/sociala-zdravje-smrt/zdravje/sociala-osebni-zdravnik.html), whether it is a family doctor, paediatrician, gynaecologist or dentist. Because of the lack of access to family medicine doctors in some parts of the country, many people do not have a personal doctor. For all these people, access to health services is very difficult.

The Health Insurance Institute of Slovenia (ZZZS) regularly publishes [a list of doctors and medical practitioners who can be selected as personal doctors](https://zavarovanec.zzzs.si/wps/portal/portali/azos/ioz/ioz_izvajalci). A few years ago, [Sebastian Ple≈°ko](https://plesko.si/) already published this information in a more useful format and received a positive response, but unfortunately, due to the frequent changes in the data, it was not been feasible to maintain the data website on a regular basis.

That's why we at the Tracker Scientific Society has decided to present this information in a more user-friendly way: with a directory and a search engine that allows us to quickly see the availability of doctors in our area.

The data are taken from official records of the ZZZS and the GURS, however we cannot guarantee their accuracy. This sometimes leads to discrepancies in the display of "Admits new patients/Does not admit new patients" or the location of the official outpatient clinics - we thank you for understanding and ask you to inform us of such discrepancies using the form provided on each surgery's card.

Data use, feedback and participation are encouraged. [Data](https://github.com/sledilnik/zdravniki-data) is collected from public domain sources and is free to use, edit, modify or include in any non-market content, provided the source is acknowledged - doctors.tracker.org.

## Personal data protection

We provide information on the processing of personal data pursuant to Articles 13, 14 and 30 of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and on the use of web cookies pursuant to Article 157 of the Act on Electronic Communications (ZEKom-1).

The "Doctors" project processes personal data about personal doctors and data about website users.

The basis for the processing is the pursuit of the legitimate interests of the controller (Article 6(1)(f) of the GDPR), namely helping the public to choose a personal doctor.

The controller is the Scientific Association Sledilnik, Celov≈°ka cesta 111, 1000 Ljubljana, drustvo@sledilnik.org.

## Processing of doctors data

The purpose of processing data on doctors is to facilitate the process of finding and choosing a personal doctor.

For this purpose, the operator collects and processes the following publicly available data on doctors, obtained from the website of the ZZZS: the name and surname of the doctor; the health care institution within which he/she works, together with the contact details of the institution; information on how many days per week he/she works within the institution (" scope of employment"); the number of identified persons (patients) in each age group; the head coefficient of the doctor or health care team calculated from these figures; whether or not he/she is accepting new patients.

These lists are supplemented by the contact details of individual doctors, obtained from the publicly accessible websites of the healthcare institutions or from other publicly accessible sources: e-mail address and telephone number.

The processing methods carried out by the controller using the accessible data include:
extraction of data from the source;
conversion into machine-readable form;
additional processing to facilitate use on the website (preparation of code lists, etc.);
depositing the machine-readable form of the data in a repository [GitHub](https://github.com/sledilnik/zdravniki-data);
visualisation in the form of a directory of personal doctors;
visualisation in the form of a map of personal doctors;
searchable by personal doctor.

Personal data is kept for as long as it is valid.

Data security (Article 32 of the GDPR) is ensured by two-factor authentication, which is required to store, modify and delete data in the github repository. The website simply visualises the data or allows searching the database.

Personal data is not specifically transferred to users in a third country, but is accessible online to users from abroad - in the same way as the data sources themselves.

## Processing of personal data about website visitors

The purpose of collecting and processing visitor data is to ensure the smooth operation of the website and to conduct statistical analyses of website traffic.

The controller processes the following data about visitors to the website: IP address, time of visit, information about the page the visitor wishes to visit and the data sent by the user's web browser in the header of each request.

The processing carried out by the controller with the assistance of contractual processors includes: accessibility of the website; authentication of the user or prevention of access by automated tools; checking and deterring attempts to hack into the website (IDS/IPS) or to disable the website (DOS); checking and deterring other breaches of information security.

The processing is carried out on the hosting provider's servers and is additionally secured using Cloudflare's content delivery network (CND). The Controller has entered into appropriate agreements with the Cloudflare network and the server space providers, which also include more detailed information on the processing of personal data (Article 28 of the GDPR).

## Cookies

Use of the Tracker would not be possible without CloudFlare, the web service through which we stream data, which places a single cookie on your computer to ensure its smooth operation and which remains there for a maximum of 30 days. For more information on privacy [please visit the Cloudflare Cookies website](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/get-started/cloudflare-cookies).
